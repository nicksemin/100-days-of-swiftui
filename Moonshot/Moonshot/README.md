## Project 8

The project incorporated almost everything what was learned so far about Swift and SwiftUI:
 - Views and stacks 
 - NavigationView and NavigationLink
 - Lists

And a few new things: 
 - Hierarchical codable data and decoding JSON
 - ScrolView, grids and GeometryReader
 - Working with images
